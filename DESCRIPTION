Description: This package provides extensive global and small-area estimation
    procedures for multiphase forest inventories under the design-based Monte-Carlo
    approach. The implementation includes all estimators for simple and cluster
    sampling published by Daniel Mandallaz between 2007 and 2014, providing point
    estimates, their external- and design-based variances as well as confidence
    intervals. The procedures have also been optimized for the use of remote sensing
    data as auxiliary information.
